Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Daqo New Energy Second Quarter 2023 Results 
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions].
I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. [indiscernible], Investor Relations Director. Please 
go ahead.
Unidentified Company Representative
Hello, everyone. I'm , the Investor Relations of Daqo New Energy. Thank you for 
joining our conference call today. Daqo New Energy just issued its financial results

Longgen Zhang
Thank you, . Good morning, good evening. Efficient operation of our polysilicon 
facilities in the second quarter of 2023 resulted in the production volume of 45,306 
metric tons, representing an increase of 11,458 metric tons as compared to the 
previous quarter.
As our Phase 5A 100,000 metric tons polysilicon project in Inner Mongolia reached 
full production capacity in June. Our production cost decreased by 8.3% from Q1 to 
¤6.92 per kg, primarily due to improvements in manufacturing efficiency as well as 
a reduction in the cost of metallurgical grade silicon.
For the quarter, we generated ¤230 million in EBITDA with strong operating cash 
flow and continued to maintain a strong balance sheet with no financial debt. At the 
end of the quarter, the company had a cash balance of ¤3.2 billion and a combined 
cash and banking notes receivable balance of USD 4 billion.
With an addition of our new Inner Mongolia Phase 5A facility, our total annual 
polysilicon nameplate capacity has expanded to 205,000 metric tons. For the third 
quarter, we expect our total polysilicon production volume to be approximately 
55,000 metric tons to 57,000 metric tons, representing an increase of 21% to 26% 
as compared to Q2 2023. Full year production is expected to be approximately 
193,000 metric tons to 198,000 metric tons of polysilicon, representing an increase 
of 44% to 48% as compared to 2022.
In addition, based on our [Technical Difficulty] figure, our new semiconductor grade 
polysilicon project with 1,000 metric tons annual capacity is expected to start pilot 
production by the end of September of this year. With our fully digitized and highly 
automated production system that optimizes operational efficiency, improves cost 
structure and further enhances production product quality for the N-type 
polysilicon product. We are confident that our Inner Mongolia project will further 
enhance the company's competitive edge.
The polysilicon industry experienced increased challenges and substantial price 
volatility during the second quarter. Several new polysilicon facilities and new 
entrants finally started production with some reaching full capacity -- production 
capacity in the first half of this year. The shortage of polysilicon of the past 2 years 
came to an end. The increased supply ultimately led to relatively oversupply and 
excess industry inventory.
In an effort to gain market shares with inferior quality products, new entrants and 
some established industry players engaged in aggressive pricing, expectations of 
lower future pricing in the market led to delays and reductions of downstream 
customer orders, as well as aggressive pricing required by customers.
The situation wasn't significantly in the second half of May, as inventory reduction 
efforts by leading producers led to race to the bottom that saw polysilicon prices 
decline by approximately 70% at the end of the second quarter compared to Q1 
levels. In the second half of June, polysilicon prices reached bottom and customers 
began ordering aggressively at the lower prices.
By middle of July, we saw an approximately 15% to 20% price recovery compared to 
the bottom reached in June. Recently, we have also seen an increase in the ASP 
premium for N-type polysilicon with a meaningful increase in demand volume. We 
expect that this trend will further benefit us as the industry transitions to next-
generation N-type technology.
We shipped 53,502 metric tons of polysilicon in Q2, meaningfully more than our 
production level and a substantial increase over Q1 shipments. Polysilicon 
inventory at our original Xinjiang facility decreased to less than a week's production 
volume, as our facility in Inner Mongolia is newly established its products require 
customer qualification before we can ship meaningful volumes to customers, and 
the qualification process took longer than anticipated due to market volatility 
during the period.
At the end of the quarter, with customer orders on hand that covered all our 
inventory, we had practically sold all shippable products, the customer qualification 
process for the products of our Inner Mongolia facility completed successfully in 
July. And at the end of July, with brisk customer orders and demand, we had 
further reduced our polysilicon inventory to a very healthy level of approximately 1-
week of production across our 2 facilities.
For the second quarter, we recorded approximately USD 19.7 million in foreign 
exchange loss, or approximately ¤0.26 per ADS. Near the end of April, the company 
received approximately RMB 4.96 billion in cash dividends from its subsidiary 
Xinjiang Daqo, which was approximately USD 716.7 million based on the exchange 
rate on the date the dividend funds were received.
During the quarter, the company converted approximately RMB 1.85 billion to U.S. 
dollar to fund our share repurchase program, as the USD to Renminbi currency -- 
Chinese currency exchange rate fluctuated significantly during the month of May 
and June. And as required by accounting standards, we recorded an unrealized 
foreign exchange loss, primarily related to our quarter end cash balance of RMB 3.1 
billion held by the company in an offshore accounts.
Regarding the company's share buyback program. At the end of July, the company 
had already repurchased 4.16 million ADS for approximately USD 188.7 million 
under the current program with average cost of approximately USD 45.32 per ADS 
combined with the program completed in 2022. In aggregate, the company has 
already repurchased 6 million ADS for approximately USD 308.6 million.
The continuous cost reduction in solar PV products and the associated reduction in 
solar energy generation costs are expected to create substantial additional green 
energy demand, which is likely to exceed most analysis expectations. It is generally 
expected that solar PV will eventually become one of the most important energies 
to power the world.
In addition, as the solar PV technology keeps evolving, we believe that the 
increasing needs for polysilicon of very high purity, such as N-type polysilicon will 
help differentiate us from our competitors, while most of our competitors will likely 
struggle with the current market environment. Daqo New Energy has one of the 
best balance sheets in the industry with no financial debt, and this will help us with 
the current market environment successfully.
We are optimistic that as the solar end market continues to grow and as our 
customers continue to expand capacity, particularly for N-type solar products, 
prices will improve. We will continue to maintain solid growth and capture the long-
term benefits of growing global solar PV market.
Moving to outlook and guidance. The company expects to produce approximately 
55,000 metric tons to 57,000 metric tons of polysilicon during the third quarter of 
2023. The company expects to produce approximately 193,000 metric tons to 
198,000 metric tons of polysilicon for the full year of 2023, inclusive of the impact 
of the company's annual facility maintenance.
This outlook reflects Daqo New Energy's current and preliminary view as of the date 
and this press release and may be subject to change. The company's ability to 
achieve these projections is subject to risks and uncertainties. See safe harbor 
statement at the end of this press release.
Now I will turn to -- the call to our CFO, Ming. Please go ahead.
Ming Yang
Thank you, Longgen, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our earnings 
conference call today.
Now I will discuss our financial results for the second quarter of 2023. Revenues 
were ¤636.7 million compared to ¤709.8 million in the first quarter of 2023 and 
¤1.24 billion in the second quarter of 2022. The decrease in revenue compared to 
the first quarter of 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices, 
mitigated by increase in sold volume.
Gross profit was ¤258.9 million compared to ¤506.7 million in the first quarter of 
2023 and ¤947 million in the second quarter of 2022. Gross margin was 40.7% 
compared to 71.4% in the first quarter of 2023 and 76% in the second quarter of 
2022. The decrease in gross margin compared to the first quarter of 2023 was 
primarily due to lower average selling prices, which was partially mitigated by lower 
production costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were ¤43.3 million compared to ¤41.3 
million in the first quarter of 2023 and ¤14.4 million in the second quarter of 2022. 
The slightly higher SG&A expenses compared to the previous quarter was due to 
higher shipment volume that resulted in higher shipping expenses.
SG&A expenses during the second quarter also includes ¤27.5 million in noncash 
share-based compensation costs related to the company's share incentive plans 
compared to ¤28 million in the first quarter of 2023.
R&D expenses were ¤2.2 million compared to ¤1.9 million in the first quarter of 
2023 and ¤2.7 million in the second quarter of 2022. R&D expenses vary from 
period to period and reflect R&D activities that take place during the quarter. And 
most of our R&D activities for the quarter related to product purity improvement-
related activities.
Foreign exchange losses were ¤19.7 million compared to 0 in the first quarter of 
2023 and also in the second quarter of 2022. The significant volatility and 
fluctuation in the U.S. dollar to Chinese New Year exchange rate during this quarter 
resulted in primarily an unrealized foreign exchange loss related to our quarter end 
cash balance of RMB 3.1 billion held by the company in an offshore account.
And as a result of the above mentioned, income from operation was ¤214 million 
compared to ¤463.8 million in the first quarter of 2023 and ¤927.6 million in the 
second quarter of 2022. Operating margin was 33.6% compared to 65.3% in the 
first quarter of 2023 and 74.6% in the second quarter of 2022.
Net income attributable to Daqo New Energy shareholders was ¤103.7 million 
compared to ¤278.8 million in the first quarter of 2023 and ¤627.8 million in the 
second quarter of 2022. Earnings per basic ADS was ¤1.35 compared to ¤3.56 in 
the first quarter of 2023 and ¤8.36 in the second quarter of 2022.
Adjusted net income, non-GAAP attributable to the Daqo New Energy shareholders, 
including noncash share-based compensation costs, was ¤134.5 million compared 
to ¤310 million in the first quarter of 2023 and ¤630 million in the second quarter of 
2022. Adjusted earnings per basic ADS was ¤1.75 compared to ¤3.96 in the first 
quarter of 2023 and ¤8.39 in the second quarter of 2022.
EBITDA was ¤230 million for the quarter compared to ¤490 million in the first 
quarter of 2023 and ¤955 million in the second quarter of 2022. EBITDA margin was 
36% compared to 69% in the first quarter of 2023 and 76.8% in the second quarter 
of 2022.
Now on the company's financial condition. As of the June 30, 2023, the company 
had ¤3.169 billion in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash compared to ¤4.1 
billion as of March 31, 2023, and ¤3.3 billion as of June 30, 2022. As of June 30, 
2023, the noticeable balance was ¤798.5 million compared to ¤791 million as of 
March 31, 2023, and ¤1.27 billion as of June 30, 2022. Notes receivables represent 
bank notes with maturity within 6 months.
And now on the company's cash flow. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2023, net 
cash provided by operating activities was ¤786 million compared to ¤1.13 billion in 
the same period of last year. And for the 6 months ended June 30, 2023, net cash 
used in investing activities was ¤495.7 million compared to net cash used in 
investment activities was ¤80 million in the same period of 2022.
Net cash used in investment activities in the first half of 2023 was primarily related 
to the capital expenditures on the company's polysilicon project in Baotou City, 
Inner Mongolia. And for the 6 months ended June 30, 2023, net cash using finance 
activities was ¤477.5 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities 
was ¤1.58 billion in the same period of 2022.
The net cash used in financing activity in the first half of 2023 was primarily related 
to ¤174 million in the company's share repurchases and ¤306.6 million in dividend 
payments made by the company Xinjiang Daqo subsidiary to its minority 
shareholders.
And that concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we will now open the floor 
for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. First question will be from Philip Shen of ROTH MKM.
Philip Shen
Longgen, sorry to see you leave. And I was wondering if you could touch on your 
personal situation and give us some color as to timing and detail around what you 
might do next? It sounds like from the release that you're leaving effective 
immediately, but you're on the call today. So just curious, if there's anything you 
can share?
Longgen Zhang
Thank you, Philip. I think I'm working for the company more than 5 years, and I 
know everybody well. And -- then also, remember, our new CEO and Chairman, his 
stay in Daqo is longer than me. Basically, he also knows this industry very well. 
Even during the past 5 years, we were working together. And so I think giving 
personal -- I think family personal reason, I'm leaving, but I think still I turn over the 
control to Mr. Xu. I think -- I hope -- I think he will direct the company to the next 
high step.
Did I answer your question, Philip?
Philip Shen
Yes. Shifting over to pricing. You talked about the dynamics of how pricing fell in 
Q2, and then there was a bit of a recovery. Can you talk about what you see for 
polysilicon pricing in Q3, Q4 and also 2024? How much higher or lower could poly 
pricing go in 2024?
Longgen Zhang
I think in last year Q4, during the seasonal and also some downstream clients, I 
think they're planning to stop demand, shut down the capacity. So almost the 5 
bigger polysilicon plants have the inventory by the end of last year. And -- but as 
the Q1, when -- because Chinese New Year is coming in February, so demand 
immediately come up.
So in Q1, the price continue to go up back from, I think, Q4, the bottom almost RMB 
80 per kg to 240, but really, because I think new entrants, the inventory, I think, 
digested. So in Italy, I think to buy, I think in May and June, the price continue go 
down. especially, I think in June, the price almost go down to the bottom.
Basically, I think breakeven even, I can call. RMB go to like RMB 55 to RMB 60. 
Then for some reason, as you know that, by the end of last month, I think 2 
companies, I'm not mentioning, okay, they have -- I think the facilities have some 
sparing the bomb you see, almost one of the big players, almost stop Xinjiang all 
production.
So I think right now, besides I think the market come back, the order is coming, I 
think, in the pipeline, especially some order in [indiscernible] is continuing, we see 
in Q3, Q4. So the demand right now is a little high. So the price right now back like 
N-type is around RMB 83 to RMB 85 per kg. The P-type, I think, is around like RMB 
65 -- RMB 63, RMB 65 per kg.
So we think in Q3, we see is very profitable. I think in this situation will continue 
lasting to October. Then during November and December, another, I think, seasonal 
come up, the winter is coming. The Western country maybe the Christmas Day, then 
Chinese New Year is coming. So I think during November, December or January and 
February, the price definitely go to deep again.
Also, I think as other, if you like -- like Daqo Mongolia, we have full capacity 
running. Then like TBEA, they also -- the first project in Mongolia is not very 
successful, okay? Last year, they started trial production, still not full capacity 
running. But they will now tell the market, they were capacity running by next 
month.
So we see the supply has continued to go up. So I think the next year, the 
polysilicon price, even next 2 years, especially, I think very clear, the polysilicon 
produced in China right now, is a different price from polysilicon produced outside 
of China. For example, like Wacker, OCI because they can easily to traceability to 
export use their silicon produce final products export to U.S.
Right now, I think next 2 years, Chinese polysilicon maybe were stable, maybe 
between, I think, around RMB 60 to around RMB 70 -- between RMB 75, I think like 
that channel. That's what I'm thinking, okay. Then I think this also will push, I think, 
some Chinese producer -- silicone producer will move outside to China to other 
locations outside of China to produce silicon.
As you can see that like in U.S. IRA already attract a lot of company, right now 
Chinese company to do the module, I think, sell even waiver. So I think that 
tendency will continue to come in. So I think globally, I think after 2 to 3 years, I 
think the Chinese maybe [indiscernible] the capacity is not only silicon, maybe 
wafer cell always oversupply right now.
So that's why cost of module price right now from RMB 2 per watt down to like near 
RMB 1.4 per watt. Definitely the good thing because returns on projects is higher. 
But that may be stimulate the installation, but also a lot of installation continue 
going on the market demand and in-store, then go to grid also have come -- have 
problems, especially in China.
So it's all trade-off. You're thinking you see the module price go down, maybe you 
will increase II on the project. But in the meantime, you see the connect to the grid 
delay also will affect the returns on II. So -- but China right now, the market is so 
hot, we think the rooftop, the SOE , I think it's all going on.
So I don't think any problem. Within 2 years, I think Europeans continue to go -- I 
think continue to grow. The only thing the over-label force action in Europe is 
starting 2025 Q2. So I think that's give time to the Chinese producer to move the 
production outside of China. So I think that's -- you see my -- what I'm thinking to 
the whole market in the future.
But remember, Daqo is the only one in China right now, know that produce high-
quality products can compete with Wacker. So especially, I think as the N-type 
silicon continue to grow, we already see the price difference between N-type and P 
is around right now RMB 8 to RMB 10 per kg. So our advantage is very clear. If you 
look at our Q2, I think the gross margin is almost more than 50%. I think we still can 
keep our gross margin even, let's say, in Q3, Q4, still above -- even Q4 still above 
30%. I think 20% is our premium compared with other players, competitors based 
on the quality and the cost effective and the scale.
Philip Shen
Great. That was a lot of color. You said something very interesting just now about 
how China -- Chinese producers could launch and ramp capacity outside of China 
to serve the U.S. and other -- maybe even Europe.
Longgen Zhang
Middle East.
Philip Shen
So I was wondering if you could highlight -- right. So can you talk about -- like do 
you guys have plans to ramp up facilities outside of China? And then how many 
metric tons do you see? Are there announcements already of who could be 
ramping? And which countries and what's the timing of when those things -- when 
those facilities could ramp?
And then also, you talked about this price delta between Chinese and non-Chinese 
polysilicon pricing. Can you talk about what the magnitude of that premium is? A 
few -- a couple of months ago, I think it was something around ¤10 delta. What is 
the non-China poly price now? And do you expect that difference to maintain? Or do 
you think that could get closer over time?
Longgen Zhang
Basically, if you look at the figure today, outside of China silicon, majority is 
Wacker, OCI and Hemlock. I think add together, it's around 80,000 tons. That 
cannot meet, I think, even U.S. market, 50 GW, let's say, 50 GW, I think, needed at 
least, I think, 120,000 metric tons, right? Of course, I think the U.S. is not only just 
polysilicon module. There may be also same thing in other stuff.
So we see, basically, I think Europe, U.S. U.S. is a typical market is not only besides 
you see the -- I think I stimulus because also the political issues. For example, the 
antidumping, the tariff, all the stuff, CBD, AD and plus, I think, over-label force that 
reaction. All these, I think, you can see today, for example, like Trina, I think they 
use Wacker materials produced in Vietnam from wafer cell module. This can easily 
selling, I think the module to U.S. around ¤0.40 per watt.
Also, I think [indiscernible] do the same thing. So I think in the U.S. market right 
now, the market can absorb high module price. It's already there, I think. Then as I 
think the U.S. market continue asking for -- from I think model to cell and wafer 
step-by-step required localization materials, I think that will push the capacity from 
module, cell and silicon.
The same situation, I think, will happen in Europe. So Europe, I think from you have 
to -- I think in the future, I think -- I'm not remember that maybe 85% or 65%, you 
have localization. So that's why I think a lot of Chinese single player will move to 
Europe.
But today, you see I think the production ecosystem, I think the environmental, I 
think Middle East, Southern Asia, maybe same as China, I think it can produce, I 
think, the lowest cost the effective module products. So it's a lot of right now, 
company right now because I think go to the Middle East, like Saudi, UAE and 
Oman, Qatar because they have 20, 30 versions in the Middle East and also the 
strong relationship right now political relations with China.
So we see a lot of China -- you see also a lot of news come out. You can see CECL 
the news with the industry, right? You can see that. And also U.S., you also can see, 
I think, LONGi, Jinko expansion in U.S. and Europe, then a lot of right now, I think, 
not only module, but also, I think the wafer capacity right now is moving to Europe.
So I think this has happened. I think, become global production, global products. 
That's a good thing. I think -- that's also very easy. I think the market demand and 
supply become more healthy.
Philip Shen
Great. Just a follow-up...
Longgen Zhang
Yes.
Philip Shen
Sorry to interrupt you. Just to kind of focus the conversation a little bit. Just I 
thought you were referring to Chinese polysilicon producers ramping facilities in 
the -- outside of China. Do you -- are you aware of any of those activities? And do 
you think you might ramp polysilicon production facilities outside of China? And if 
so, where would that still be the Middle East and maybe Southeast Asia or would 
that be some other locations?
Longgen Zhang
I think it definitely is, I think, a very -- I think the economic stimulus to attract 
Chinese producer to move outside of China to produce the silicon. But if you 
remember that silicon plant is capital-intensive, also environmental, and also in the 
chemical industry. So the design, the permits, all this, I think, is very high.
Daqo also did a lot of research. For example, if we go to U.S., maybe taking 5 years 
to finish the construction, then 10x the total investment. So it's impossible for us to 
set the plants in any Chinese, I think, producer to set the plants in U.S. Then if you 
go to other places like Middle East, you have considering.
If you set up plants in outside of China, what's the competitive edge, right? If the 
cost of the final product is still used in the local, then it's no competitive edge. The 
only chance is traceability the products can go to Europe, go to the U.S. than 
meeting some.
Today, if you look at the PV link, I think last week, I think, Wacker, I think 
international polysilicon ¤27 to, I think, ¤35 whatever. And China right now is 
around like ¤10 to ¤11. So the difference is there. I think that will continue to exist 
the reason because the -- I just mentioned that outside of China, silicon only 
80,000 tons.
There's no way within 2 years can increase. We also didn't see any existing player, 
for example, OCI, Wacker, Hemlock, their expansion. So we also didn't see any 
Chinese producer is going to -- planning to set plants outside of China. At least 
right now, we didn't see any news.
Daqo is a little different because we right now, I think, a list in U.S. then also listing 
Asia. So for a U.S. company, we cannot compete business with, I think, Asia 
company. So the silicon we only can do the Asia. So that's we'll be careful. I think 
with the new Chairman and CEO, I think Mr. Xu, I think he has the future planning. I 
think yes, we are looking at a study anytime if possible.
Philip Shen
Okay. That's really very good color. One last question for me. We recently wrote that 
LONGi's the tained product in the U.S. using Tongwei poly from maybe 4 or 5 
months ago, that was the tained was denied entry into the U.S. I know you're 
ramping your Inner Mongolia facilities now.
What is your -- what do you think your ability is to import your poly through 
Southeast Asia into the U.S. now? Are you a little bit more pessimistic given the 
LONGi's situation? Or are you still optimistic because you have traceability to the 
port site?
Longgen Zhang
Frankly speaking, I'm very pessimistic. The reason is because Tongwei -- of course, 
Tongwei's situation is may be a little different. At least they are, I think, have 
different locations. I think the U.S. customer, I think depend LONGi the reason 
because as Tongwei on the whole global, they maybe use Xinjiang silicon store. 
They cannot improve they didn't use, right?
So yes, we have to see because at this moment, because of critical, I think, conflict, 
I think, what I want to say is difficult to clear any player right now can be 
traceability. Any silicon produced in China can be pass the traceability to export to 
U.S. But -- if we can do to show in Mongolia, starting from all to industry silicon to 
silicon powder to silicon producer, the whole value chain to show, I think we don't 
know, right? We have to try it, right? So I can tell you, but we will make our efforts.
Operator
Our next question will be from Alan Lau, Jefferies.
Alan Lau
Happy to hear Longgen is moving on. And thanks for the contribution to the 
company as well in the past year. So my first question is what is the CapEx plan for 
the remaining of this year and next year?
Ming Yang
Okay. So if you look at the CapEx plan, okay, so I would say in the first half, right, so 
I think for -- from our financial statements, are approximately ¤495.7 million was 
used in investing activities, and that's pretty much used for CapEx, mostly related 
to our Inner Mongolia Phase 2. And some of it is [indiscernible] Mongolia Phase 1.
And then for the second half, we're currently planning an additional ¤750 million in 
CapEx. In aggregate, this is mostly used for Inner Mongolia Phase 2, which is under 
construction, right, now. And then less than ¤100 million will be in the final 
payments to Inner Mongolia Phase 1.
So I think in aggregate, for the full year, we were planning roughly ¤1.25 billion in 
CapEx. So that's the current CapExn plan right now.
Alan Lau
So another question is, since the average selling pol price in Q2 is lower than the 
average market price in the market, so I would like to ask how -- is the company 
selling more in July -- June instead of April? And what is this -- what is the split 
between the different months because the prices have been declining also?
Longgen Zhang
First of all, I don't know where you got the ASP -- market ASP, then you can make a 
decision we are below ASP. But I can tell you because we are as a company digest 
all the inventory. So basically, yes, we're sliding -- our price is very competitive, but 
compare our quality, I still think is challengeable. We still is very profitable.
So if you look at Tongwei, I think their whole industry together, I think the increase -
- the profit in the second quarter almost cutting half less than half. We still have 
more than 50% increase hail -- couple of half, more than high than the half. So I 
don't think you -- it's apple-to-apple. I still think we're selling pretty good, I think, 
ASP to the good clients, yes.
Alan Lau
Because they are guiding that they are selling at around RMB 120 per kilogram, so I 
saw our numbers around 97 or 98, including tax. So that's why that's a question. 
Maybe there's some timing difference. I'm not sure.
Longgen Zhang
Yes. It's maybe not apple-to-apple. Really, we're not to comment another company, 
but that's a factor. We are -- I think the figure we tell you.
Alan Lau
Understand. So how about the share buyback pace because -- since the buyback in 
Q2 was not very aggressive. So can I assume the company will accelerate the 
buyback in Q3 because you have more than ¤500 million left?
Ming Yang
So yes, I think we still have ¤500 million -- more than ¤500 million left on the 
company's -- the parent company's balance sheet in the offshore account, which we 
will use for the share buyback program. And the share buyback program continues 
to be in place and has not been changed.
And certainly, we will look forward to support the share price especially now with 
the new Chairman and CEO onboard. And I think as well our new plans for the 
company. And certainly, I think and obviously subject to for some market 
conditions, our share price and other factors, things like that, but we will continue 
to execute on our share buyback program.
Longgen Zhang
But we assure I think we're going to finish the ¤700 million purchase program, right, 
by the end of the year.
Ming Yang
That's the current expectation.
Longgen Zhang
I think that's right.
Alan Lau
So yes, that's quite positive. And my last question is -- what is the view on 
aggressive expansion by others? Because some of the peers are actually having 
concrete due diligence in Saudi. So I wonder if we are also investigating the 
expansion plan in Saudi or other places where we see more relevant or more 
feasible for us?
Ming Yang
Okay. We did investigate in overseas expansion in the past, actually quite actively, 
and we did actually even sent our teams overseas to do due diligence. And we 
continue to think and there are a lot of challenges to overseas expansion, 
particularly, for example, around the higher production costs and the sustainability 
of the price premium and as well as the market opportunities. So we certainly are 
continuing to monitor the various opportunities, but I think as of now, the company 
has no plan to do overseas expansion right now.

The next question will come from Ji Chao of Goldman Sachs.
Ji Chao
Can I ask what's the portion of the N-type poly for the first half this year? And how -
- what kind of a portion would you expect for the full year? And also, we note that 
the second quarter operating cash flow is actually negative. Can you also share why 
is that?
Ming Yang
Okay. Ji Chao, thank you very much for your questions.
So with regard to N-type, so the percentage keeps improving. So in Q1, it was 
roughly in the range of 10% to 20%. And actually, for Q2, we've already increased it 
to the range of 20% to 30%, I think based on the company's, both in the market 
conditions and the market demand from the customers and also the price premium 
and that's afforded in the market.
So I think towards the end of Q2, now that price premium is in RMB 10 to RMB 15 
per kilogram range for N-type relative P-type, we are actually modifying our 
process and optimizing our process to produce more N-type. I think in the second 
half, right now, our expectation is that N-type will constitute somewhere between 
30% to 50% of our production.
So obviously, Xinjiang is a more mature process and -- but the equipment has a 
little bit more limitation on the entire percentage, but we think we can improve it 
further. But Inner Mongolia is in the process of improving its quality and ramping 
up. So we're very optimistic that over time, the Inner Mongolia N-type percentage 
will increase meaningfully.
Let me follow-up on the second question. Can you repeat your second question 
again?
Ji Chao
Sure. The second quarter operating cash flow seems to be negative. Can I ask why 
is that?
Ming Yang
The negative is -- for the 6 months, we had ¤786 million, I think the operating cash 
flow.
Ji Chao
Right, right. But it seems that the first quarter cash flow is like more than ¤800 
million. So it seems like the second quarter is slightly negative?
Ming Yang
It's probably related to our bank note sales. Let me follow-up with you on the topic.
Operator
Next question will be from [indiscernible].
Unidentified Analyst
So my question is, so we have changes in our management team. And I want to ask 
due to our [indiscernible] management, do we have plan to launch new business or 
do new investments?
Longgen Zhang
I think the change of the new management team, I think Mr. Xu is the Chairman and 
CEO new. I think he's also the biggest shareholder and the controller -- and the Asia 
controller. I think yes, maybe I think in the future, definitely, we were looking to do 
some study. But we still, I think we're focused on our existing business.
And as we lay down 3- to 5-year strategy, you see extremely do in the industry 
silicon metal, then also we were the poly, I think 1,000 semiconductor products is 
welcome our -- are start production starting, I think, Q3. So our strategy didn't 
change. Of course, we are looking at other opportunities, maybe overseas, maybe 
downstream. But right now, we will announce there really.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And my next question is do we consider to go in private because we have a 
lot of cash and this cash maybe somehow cover our market cap. So do you 
consider to go private?
Longgen Zhang
I think privatization -- with going to privatization is not management team to make 
decision and we have to go through the whole shareholders. But definitely, one 
thing is clear, I think the valuation between Asia and U.S. share is -- the difference 
is higher.
So right now, we only have a channel is going to throw Asia to declare dividends to 
buyback the U.S. shares. So it's anti-diluted. As you can see, right? So I think we 
think that the price can continue as the variation in U.S. market can continue to go 
up.
But I want to remind you, by the June 23 -- July 23 next year does mean after we 
IPO in Asia after 3 years, the U.S. company holding 73% of Asia, we can sell it, start 
reselling. So that means we have another channel. We can sell the Asia to get the 
money then back to U.S. market to buyback the U.S. shares.
So basically, we think in the future, if the valuation is so different, you see, we can 
sell that to [indiscernible] definitely we will reduce the circulating shares, you see. 
And that's, I think, to push in the market, right? But with privatization, I don't think 
so for long-term because we also want to U.S. shareholders to get -- to share our 
benefits.

Our next question will be from Leo Ho [indiscernible].
Unidentified Analyst
This is Leo Ho from Daiwa Capital Markets. A couple of questions. I would like to 
ask one by one if I may.
The first question is regarding share buyback. I just would like to confirm that, so 
our current plan is that we are going to spend the entirety of the USD 700 million 
within this year. Am I correct?
Ming Yang
I would say -- let me just say that I think with some ¤700 million program is in 
place. And I think there has been no changes to that. I think certainly, the company 
and the management team will continue to monitor the market and repurchase the 
shares. Yes. I think based on the share repurchase program, yes.
Unidentified Analyst
My second question is regarding the second quarter production number. I noticed 
that we have produced 45,000 tons eventually. But according to your first quarter 
guidance, we should be producing around 55,000 tons in the second quarter. May I 
know what is the reason behind the 10,000-ton discrepancy? Are we doing like any 
retrofit for our old or new capacity? What's the reason behind? And if we are doing 
retrofit, can you briefly tell us what capacity or which -- in which provinces that we 
are doing?
Ming Yang
I think I'm just looking at our previous guidance. I think we guided to 44,000 to 
46,000 tons of production for Q2. So we actually produced more -- pretty much in 
line with our previous guidance. So it is basically in line. I think as we ramp up our 
Inner Mongolia as we expected. And then it's for the Q2 that was not what we're 
expecting, in, I think, 55,000 to 57,000 metric tons. So that's reflecting the full 
ramp-up of the Inner Mongolia facility.
Unidentified Analyst
So are we doing any like retrofit in the second quarter?
Longgen Zhang
I think if you look at the end of Q1, we have inventory almost, I think tons. So in Q2, 
we produced 45,000 tons. So then we're selling 51,000 tons, almost 52,000 tons. 
So we still have some -- an inventory in Q2. It's 10,000, 450,000 -- yes, it's a 10,550 
tons. So I think the figure is correct.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Okay. Just a few more question. I just want to know; do we have any forecast 
for the N-type product within our total production mix for 2024? And also, I would 
like to know at this point in time, aside from us how many producers in the market 
do you see are capable manufacturing N-type polysilicon at large scale?
Ming Yang
So I think for 2024, we expect N-type to be greater than 50%. I think, in fact, I think 
once we'll fully ramp up in terms of our updates to our optimization of our process, 
we should have N-type in the range of 70% to 90% for the company, especially for 
next year.
The internal number of producers, I think right now, we are one of the largest 
producer of N-type and supplier of N-type producers in the market. I think the other 
main producers include Wacker and then some from Asia silicon and then some 
from [indiscernible], but I think they are the main ones.
Unidentified Analyst
My last question is on joint ventures. I think for amongst large polysilicon 
producers in China, it seems like we are the only one without any joint venture with 
downstream customers. Are we planning to form any joint venture in the future? 
And why we didn't form any of them in the past?
Ming Yang
I mean we won't roll this possibility out. I think in the past, we want to be kind of a 
pure play and really the primary merchant supplier of polysilicon. And I think that 
benefited us very well, especially last year, where I think some of our peers have 
had a JV partners or minority investors have to where we have shared a lot of their 
offshore income with the shareholders.
So obviously, I think with the recent market trends, actually, a number of customers 
have approached us and indicated the interest in doing minority or JV investments. 
So that is something that we are in discussion, but there's nothing in concrete to 
report.
